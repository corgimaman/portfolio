        <p>
          My name is Ida and welcome to my portfolio page. I entered the University of Houston August 2010, and graduated December 2013 with a Bachelor's of Science in Geology.
          I soon after got a job as a geophysicist and then left to Guam in January 2015 to pursue my masters degree. While on Guam, I recieved a SCUBA certificate and swam my first competitve swim (5 miles in the ocean).
          I graduated two years later with a Masters of Science in Environmental Science, presenting my thesis to a packed room, including people from the local water works agency, EPA, and even a senator.
          Shortly after presenting my thesis, I hopped on an airplane and backpacked around Asia for a few months. During that time, I did a 200-hour Yoga Teacher Training course in Rishikesh, India.
          I returned back home to Houston, Texas and worked independently as a caretaker before working full time as an Environmental Consultant (March 2018 to present).

          In February 2021, I took a Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp from Rice University and received my certificate in August 2021. During this bootcamp I learned to design responsive websites, work with JavaScript, GitHub, and more.
          I am also proficient in photography, video filimng, and processing (Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom). In my spare time I can be found at the gym, traveling, or doing yoga or embroidery.
          My goal is to end up somewhere in between the beach and mountains, volunteering rescuing animals, and being able to travel to see my family.
